    A base component manager for SKA Mid.CBF MCS

    This class exists to modify the interface of the
    :py:class:`ska_tango_base.executor.executor_component_manager.TaskExecutorComponentManager`.
    The ``TaskExecutorComponentManager`` accepts ``max_queue_size`` keyword argument
    to determine limits on worker queue length, for the management of
    SubmittedSlowCommand (LRC) threads.

    Additionally, this provides optional arguments for attribute change event and
    HealthState updates, for a device to pass in its callbacks for push change events.

    Finally, the ``TaskExecutorComponentManager`` inherits from BaseComponentManager,
    which accepts the keyword arguments communication_state_callback and
    component_state_callback, each with an analoguous callback method in the
    SKABaseDevice (namely _communication_state_changed and _component_state_changed)
    used to drive the operational state (opState) model from the component manager.
